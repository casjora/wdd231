        <p>This page will be your "<em>pen-knife</em>" for your day to day work as an interpreter</p>

            <h2>OPI - Over The Phone Interpretation</h2>

            <p><em>Over-the-phone interpretation</em> is in high demand nowadays.</p>
            <p>We understand how difficult your job is and how little room for error is accepted from you.</p>
            <p>That's why we've created this toolbox so you know where to find the assistance you need.</p>
            <h3>What's in here for me?</h3>
            <p>Have you always wondered: </p> 
            <ul>
                <li>What should I do if another party joins the call?</li>
                <li>What should I do if a client needs to leave the room?</li>
                <li>What's the process I need to follow in case I encounter an unfamiliar term during a call?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>That's why you'll find here a guide of industry standardized protocols (how to handle day-to-day scenarios), and the most accepted terminology map based on the industry of your call!</p>
